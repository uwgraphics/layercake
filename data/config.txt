# OPTIONAL PARAMETERS #
########################

# A "-1' indicates to use the internal default value for a given optional parameter - alternatively you can just delete the line.
# How many base pairs are averaged together into one glyph? If the value supplied is too big (so there's not enough space to examine a bin on the screen) or too small (so there are too many glyphs to show on the screen at once), this value will be overwritten.
